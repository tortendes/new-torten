# New Torten

This is currently the Github repository for developing my new site.
Currently not the main one since this is currently on development but, it should be acessible at [this link](https://new.torten.xyz) sometime soon.

Written with Svelte, Tailwind CSS and mdsvex.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
